AFRO 259,,TR,09:30 AM,10:45 AM,LCD,,"FA23 AFRO 259/CWL 259/ ENGL 259 Early African American Lit - Christopher Freeburg:  An introduction to the study of early African American literary and cultural production, ranging from the earliest writings by African descended people in British North America in the eighteenth century to the end of World War I. At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text's moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the ""African-ness"" and ""American-ness"" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons—philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental—and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization. Writers may include Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Maria Stewart, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Frances E.W. Harper, William Wells Brown, W.E.B. Du Bois, Pauline Hopkins, Charles Chesnutt, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Alice Dunbar Nelson, and Ida B. Wells.",,https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2023/fall/AFRO/259/55609.xml

At each turn, we will situate texts in their cultural and historical contexts, attending not only to the specificity of a particular text's moment, but also to the forces of contingency and tradition at play in the construction of literary, cultural, and political communities. Throughout our discussions we will think about both the ""African-ness"" and ""American-ness"" of African American literature as collective and imaginative processes. Early African Americans wrote for a variety of reasons—philosophical, political, pleasurable, instrumental—and protesting slavery and racism was just one (albeit an important one) among many of those reasons. We will read letters, poems, sermons, songs, constitutions and bylaws for religious and civic organizations, stories, and texts that defy easy categorization.

In this course, we focus on the social, political, economic, medical, and cultural formations that shaped and characterized the experiences of African Americans.  This course is designed to show how African American’s historical identity grew directly out of their experience in a unique American society based on human slavery and racial inequality, among other things. Key topics include Atlantic slavery, slavery in the colonial era, the expansion of domestic slavery, enslaved people’s resistance strategies, growing civic and political activism and principles of self-determination within free black communities, and the Civil War, emancipation, and its aftermath.",,https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2023/fall/HIST/275/34288.xml

ENGL 285,,MWF,01:00 PM,01:50 PM,LCD,,"FA23 ENGL 285 Postcolonial Lit in English - Manisha Basu: As Deepika Bahri writes, although there is considerable debate about the exact parameters of the field and even the definition of the term postcolonial, in a very general sense, it refers to the interactions between European nations and the societies they colonized in the modern period. These interactions were violent, sometimes grotesquely funny, always shifting, and above all, transformative for both sides – colonizer and colonized. This is why we begin our course with a text that despite having been authored by perhaps the most representative literary figure of the Western canon expresses a distinctly uneasy relationship with the colonial encounter. As such, William Shakespeare's The Tempest will function as our entry point into a host of other writings, including, by the iconic Nigerian novelist, Chinua Achebe, the Antiguan writer, Jamaica Kincaid, the West Indian poet, Derek Walcott, the South African novelist, Doris Lessing, and the Indian theoretician, Ania Loomba, all composed in the wake of mid-twentieth century liberation struggles across the globe. At this time, many writers from what used to be called the third-world began to give expression to their cultural experiences in the language of the former colonial power. Given that it is called Postcolonial Literature in English, it is the language of the former colonial power that will be significant for our readings in this course. We will strive to understand what forms the Queen's English takes as it attempts to carry the weight of diverse realities, as it negotiates the taut relations between class, gender, racial and religious identities, and as it shapes and reshapes itself in the midst of changing social institutions, lifestyles, and habits.",,https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2023/fall/ENGL/285/32221.xml

This was the first global age, when trade, conquest, and colonization connected all parts of the globe as never before. By 1800, all large areas of human settlement and culture everywhere on Earth interacted with one another – some only barely, others in deep and transforming ways.

HIST 120,,MW,01:00 PM,01:50 PM,LEC,,"Description:  The Twentieth-first Century is increasingly hailed by political commentators and historians as the “Asian Century” and the “Chinese Century.” The re-emergence of China as an economic and political power in the closing decades of the last century has created strong interests as well as concerns about a world in which one dominating power is an East Asian country. Deep-rooted stereotypes and uninformed speculations have further bewildered and troubled scholars and the public in the West about the reasons for the miraculous rise of China and the implications of its ascendancy for the world. How China and Japan developed into great powers as they did after WWII and the Cold War calls for a better understanding of the past of these two countries. We will explore issues of critical importance to our understanding of East Asian cultures and history from contemporary perspectives: issues such as identity formation, gender and women’s experience, power and knowledge production, racism, as well as imperialism, etc.",,https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2023/fall/HIST/120/34319.xml

Though we might think of the United States as having a linear progress narrative with the eventual output of what we call “American literature,” our goal in this course will be to examine these assumptions and attempt to understand how and why we define American literature as we do. In this endeavor, we will read and discuss a variety of genres (essays and speeches, fiction and nonfiction, “canon” and “non-canon” alike) in order explore the tropes, forms, and ideas woven into these texts.

Some of these journeys navigate historical landscapes: a Viking sailor makes first contact with the Indigenous peoples of North America, a Moroccan scholar follows the caravan routes to African Mali, and a Japanese concubine takes up the itinerant life of a Buddhist nun after her exile from the imperial court. Others traverse imaginary terrain: a Hindu king is reunited with his family atop a celestial mountain, a flock of Persian birds cross seven mystical valleys in search of their ruler, a Chinese woman’s soul follows her beloved to the capital while her body languishes at home, and a transgender knight wanders the forests of Arthurian legend on a quest for Merlin. What these journey stories all share is an interest in encountering the Other (barbarians, foreigners, monsters, prodigies, heretics, etc.) as well as a realization of travel's potential for self-discovery--or self-alienation.

ENGL 206,,MWF,09:00 AM,09:50 AM,ONL,,"FA23 ENGL 206 Enlightenment Lit and Culture - Hina Nazar: The Enlightenment has been much in the news in recent times.  After the 2016 US presidential election, pundits all over the world declared that the Enlightenment was likely dead.  Fears about the demise of the Enlightenment were greatly heightened by the attack on the US Capitol on January 6th, 2021, since American constitutional democracy is widely considered to be one of the Enlightenment’s greatest accomplishments.  The subsequent inauguration of Joseph R. Biden as the US President was interpreted by many as signifying that the Enlightenment is not dead, after all!  This course offers you a broad-based introduction to “the Enlightenment” which surfaces so regularly in our public discourse.  While many of you are probably familiar with key texts and figures of the American Enlightenment, our focus this semester is the European, and more particularly, the British Enlightenment, which preceded the founding of the United States.  As a moment in history, the Enlightenment covers roughly the period 1650-1800.  During this time, Europe witnessed unprecedented social, economic, cultural, and political changes that collectively produced a giant leap toward the world we inhabit today.  It was an age of revolution and newfound faith in the rights of the individual, though these rights were by no means extended to all.  It was an age of reason, of tremendous advances in science and technology, though reason was by no means the only altar at which so-called enlightened men and women worshipped: God and sentiment remained powerful forces throughout the long eighteenth century.  This semester we will grapple with the principal trends (and some countercurrents) of this period by focusing on a select group of highly influential literary and non-literary works.  Our readings are divided into four parts.  After an overview of the Enlightenment spirit in Part I, we will dig deeper into such crucial concerns of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century letters as property, race, and empire (Part II); morality (Part III); and education (Part IV).  Gender, as you will see, figures prominently in all four parts.   We will explore how the individualistic mindset associated with the Enlightenment was developed in the context of the literary, philosophical, scientific, and political documents of the period, and how this mindset complicated traditional conceptions of duty and long-established social and political hierarchies.  As our precursor culture, the Enlightenment continues to speak to us today—as is evidenced by its omnipresence in current public discourse—and our aim this semester is not only to understand its core values but also to link them to our own.",,https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2023/fall/ENGL/206/39502.xml

Many of the era’s great literary works reflect this tension between political realism and dreamy romance: between the cold prospect of being a poor governess and the romance of finding true love in Jane Eyre; the tragedy of losing your best friend and the hope of emotional resilience in In Memoriam; the struggle between duty and monstrous desire in Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.   Readings in this class will also include the poetry of the Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Christina Rossetti, Olive Schreiner’s novel The Story of an African Farm, plays by Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw, political essays by John Stuart Mill and Thomas Carlyle, discussions of Victorian religion, and the Crimean War memoir of the Jamaican nurse Mary Seacole.

Rather than aiming for coverage, we will read closely a limited set of works from different genres from the eighth to the late eighteenth century, including lyric poetry, drama, satire, polemical prose, and amatory fiction. In so doing, we’ll consider how politics, religion, and landscape shaped Britain’s national literature. We’ll attend to the evolution of the English language. We’ll note how scholars use certain historical turning points to justify such boundaries as ‘medieval’, ‘early modern’, and ‘restoration’. We’ll weigh the usefulness of these categories of periodization—as well as the potential problems with them. We will furthermore analyze our emotional engagement with the works we read. What formal qualities, themes, and conventions draw us in—or, indeed, estrange us? What’s familiar about the distant past, and what’s alien, unexpected, and surprising?    Expect to encounter such writers as Unknown, Marie de France, and Geoffrey Chaucer; William Shakespeare, John Donne, and Andrew Marvell; and Margaret Cavendish, Jonathan Swift, and Eliza Haywood. Expect to visit the preaching cross near Solway firth, in what once was Northumbria; the city of York on the feast of Corpus Christi; the perilous court of King Henry VIII; the Globe theater of Shakespeare and his Chamberlain’s Men; and the dressing room of an eighteenth-century lady.

ENGL 213,,TR,09:30 AM,10:45 AM,LCD,,"FA23 ENGL 213 Modernist Lit and Culture: The twentieth century began in a moment of unprecedented social, economic and technological change. Artists in all genres – literary, visual, and musical - responded with fundamental changes in their attitude toward mainstream culture, and innovations in the forms they used that were often playful but always intense. This remarkable period of experimentation and exploration in all the arts, which can be dated roughly between 1900 and 1940, we call modernism.   We’ll examine modernism through the image and setting of “the city” as the laboratory for the 20th-century world. By 1900 most countries in the industrialized world had experienced a fundamental shift, from primarily rural to primarily urban. But not all urban spaces are the same; we’ll trace how competing models of urban space shaped the literature and culture of the early 20th century, and investigate how the emergence of the industrialized city as the dominant modern space made our world what it is, for better and worse.   Among the questions we’ll consider: What features make the “modern world” modern? How did such concepts as nation, race, gender, class, and mass culture shape 20th-century identities? How did life-changing technologies, and the unpredictable sociopolitical changes they brought, produce new styles of behavior, compulsion, and creation? How might the arts reveal, and conceivably change, that world?   Before we’re done we’ll come to see that the passionate responses of modernist artists to their challenging world helped to define 20th-century culture and society, and offer us a lens for imagining where we might be heading a century later.  Authors likely to be included are Hemingway, Eliot, Williams, Larsen, Hughes, Sandburg, Millay, McKay, Cather, and Yezierska.  You can expect to do three critical essays, be strongly encouraged to participate in discussion, and take a final exam.",,https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2023/fall/ENGL/213/46720.xml

While we can look back on the history of the geographic expanse we now name the United States and create a literary narrative, this narrative begins with an assumption that to be on the continent and write makes one an “American writer” and that what these writers produced was something we would label as “literature.” European colonizers, however, did not begin to call themselves “Americans” until the late eighteenth century, and a coherent category of “American literature” turns out to be more of a willful assertion than a completed effect even through the mid-nineteenth century. And just at the moment when the borders of the United States as a nation-state began to reflect what we generally recognize them to be today, the nation broke out in the Civil War. These paradoxes and others endemic to US culture will guide our discussions of American literature to 1865. Along the way, we will canvass a variety of genres, including poetry, travel narratives, fiction, and speeches, and we will explore the persistence of prominent tropes, forms, and ideas—and, as crucially, the decline and disappearance of others—across three centuries of writing.",,https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule/2023/fall/ENGL/255/33954.xml

We read substantial parts of the Grimms' 19th-century collections and some of their French and Italian predecessors, and we consider other storytelling forms, film, and illustration. All the while, we investigate how power, gender, race, class, and ecological issues play out in these surprisingly dense, meaningful, and very old stories. Why do we continue to tell and to know these tales? Why do certain stories recur again and again, in Western and other cultures? The power of narrative is at the center of our lives, and of these tales, and by the end of the semester we will understand this power much better.

We will learn about military operations, political ramifications (including the demise of empires and the rise of Soviet communism), about battlefront and home front (including trench warfare and chemical weapons, food rationing, and the feminization of the workforce). We will also study the war’s psychological and embodied effects (shell-shock, amputation, plastic surgery, sexuality, and disability) as well as artistic and cultural attempts to represent its devastation in poetry, art, music, dance, theatre, film, and literature. Our class investigates how WWI influenced present global concerns towards everything from terrorism and human rights to race, revolution, and global apocalypse.

These interactions are still crucial to understanding contemporary events in the Mediterranean countries in Europe, Northern Africa and Middle East. A dynamic introduction to the social and cultural history of languages spoken in countries like Greece and Egypt, Morocco and Spain, Italy and Turkey, Albania and Croatia, France and Algeria, Syria and Israel and more will be offered in this course.  The starting point will be the Mediterranean of today, tracing the historical development of the languages as an ongoing process in relation to historical events, culture, politics and religion.

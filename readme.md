## Simple program using pandas as beautiful soup to let me find out what gen ed I should take based on gen ed requirements I need to take to fulfill my major and what time the course if offered. The process was done in this order:
1. Scraped a website using a simple requests/beautiful soup program to get all of the gen ed courses and the requirements they fulfill using find_interfering_course.py. This was then output to courses.csv
2. I did some extra processing based on UIUC's API to find every single gen ed course in a given semester. The API returns an XML which is super easy to parse. This actually took a long time to run since I limited my API calls to on every 5 seconds (and there were just over 1000 rows). This extra processing allowed me to get extra information like how many sections were being offered, what times, what days, and any notes about the course.
3. I combined my two files together and ran some simple pandas functions to find classes that fit my needs
